Learner Submission Processor:

This project processes learner submission data for a JavaScript course to calculate averages and individual scores.

Explanation:

The getLearnerData function processes learner submission data.
It checks if the assignment group belongs to the specified course.
Learner data is stored and processed for each submission.
Individual scores are calculated, accounting for late submissions.
If an assignment has zero points possible, it's flagged as an error.
Finally, learner averages and individual scores are calculated and formatted.
